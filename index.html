                <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
                    looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution
                    of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
                    Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text,
                    and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still.

                            <p>Using a 3 axis accelerometer and a 3 axis gyroscope I was able to create a glove that
                                would control a robotic hand. Think of the mechanical suits from Avatar. When the driver moves
                                his arms and fingers the robots arms and fingers respond with nothing more than sensors
                                on the driver's hands. The goal was to provide a way to quickly respond with medical
                                assistance to natural disasters around the world. The number of victims just needing
                                clean bandages or medicine administered could be served by medical students and nurses
                                around the world who want to help but can commit to traveling to the location of the

                                control and use apps designed for the iPad. We built apps that could be controlled using
                                a forearm mounted set of sensors that could interpret broad strokes and gestures as
                                inputs for navigating and selecting items from the app.</p>
