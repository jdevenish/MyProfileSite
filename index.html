                <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
                    looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution
                    of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
                    Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text,
                    and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still.

                            <p>Using a 3 axis accelerometer and a 3 axis gyroscope I was able to create a glove that
                                would control a robotic hand. Think of the mechanical suits from Avatar. When the driver
                                moves his arms and fingers the robots arms and fingers respond with nothing more than
                                sensors on the driver's hands. The goal was to provide a way to quickly respond with
                                medical assistance to natural disasters around the world. The number of victims just
                                needing clean bandages or medicine administered could be served by medical students and
                                nurses around the world who want to help but can commit to traveling to the location of
                                the disaster.</p>

                            <p>As a member of this team we built a device that allowed children with cerebral palsy to
                                control and use apps designed for the iPad. We built apps that could be controlled using
                                a forearm mounted set of sensors that could interpret broad strokes and gestures as
                                inputs for navigating and selecting items from the app.</p>
