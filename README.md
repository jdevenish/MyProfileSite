# Project 1: My Profile Site

## Overview
Build a website from scratch using the skills taught during the firs section of this course. The website will be a self portfolio site displaying and linking to work I've done for homework and class labs. 

## Project Description

* Name

* Education
* Work History
* Accomplishments
* Portfolio of work:
	* Websites
	* Images built with HTML/CSS
	* Algorithm solutions

## Feature Research & Prioritization 

I started this project by researching other portfolio websites to get inspiration and a better understanding of how I would want to structure my site. The person viewing my portfolio should be able to quickly find three major things; a little about me and how I stand out from the compeition, some way to review and grade my work, and most importantly, an easy way to contact me. 

Below is how I broke down and prioritiezed the features that came my research.
