## Feature Research & Prioritization 

I started this project by researching other portfolio websites to get inspiration and a better understanding of how I would want to structure my site. The person viewing my portfolio should be able to quickly find three major things; a little about me and how I stand out from the compeition, some way to review and grade my work, and most importantly, an easy way to contact me. 

Below is how I broke down and prioritiezed the features that came my research.
